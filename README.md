## MSDetect - Eye tracking for detection of Mutliple Sclerosis

This repo contains the work done as an Insight Artifical Intelligence Fellow, consulting for a company that is using state of the art high-resolution retinal tracking hardware combined with AI to change the way Multiple Sclerosis is diagnosed and tracked in patients. 

The current model uses a model that uses engineering features that are captured by hand-labelling retinal trace data. 

I worked on exploring whether 
 

###  Environment Setup 

#### Ubuntu 18.04 

Run the following command from the terminal 

```
conda env create -f environment_linux.yml
```
This will create a new environment called `tsc-linux` with all of the necessarypackages installed. 

#### Running on Mac 

### Running the Code 


### Models 

#### Counting Saccades 


#### 1D ResNet based model 


#### LSTM based model 

### Results 

#### Micro-Saccade distribution

#### Age distribution in Controls and in Patients 

The controls are included
